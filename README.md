## Setup

For this project, I have opted to use Conda for managing Python environment and PyCharm as the code editor.
1. #### Check Python Version
    Run the following command to get python version being used
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    Ensure python version 3.10 in current environment.


2. #### Install Required Libraries

    To install all required dependencies into current environment, run the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
Note: Make sure to have activated the correct environment before running this command.
